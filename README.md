# Defold Grid Engine
Defold Grid Engine (DGE) 0.2.0 provides grid-based movement, interactions, and utility features to a Defold game engine project. Two examples of video game franchises that use grid-based systems are Pok√©mon and Fire Emblem.

Visit [my website](https://gymratgames.github.io/html/extensions.html#dge) to see an animated gif of the example project.  
An [example project](https://github.com/gymratgames/defold-grid-engine/tree/master/example) is available if you need additional help with configuration.

## Installation
To install DGE into your project, add one of the following links to your `game.project` dependencies:
  - https://github.com/gymratgames/defold-grid-engine/archive/master.zip
  - URL of a [specific release](https://github.com/gymratgames/defold-grid-engine/releases)

## Configuration
Import the DGE Lua module into your character's script:
`local dge = require "dge.dge"`

The grid system itself must be initialized before registering any characters. To initialize DGE, call `dge.init()` followed by `dge.set_collision()`. Make sure to call `dge.init()` before registering any characters:

```
local dge_config = {
    debug = true,
    stride = 16
}

local collision = {
    { 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 },
    { 2, 1, 1, 1, 2 },
    { 2, 1, 1, 1, 2 },
    { 2, 1, 1, 1, 2 },
    { 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 }
}

function init(self)
    dge.init(dge_config)
    dge.set_collision(collision)
end
```

1. `debug`: Allow debug information to be printed to the terminal.
2. `stride`: Size of a single grid box (if you're using a tilemap, then this is likely equivalent to your tile size.)

The `dge.set_collision()` function assigns a collision map to the grid. Collision maps consist of a table of lists of `integer`s, where each `integer` corresponds to a collision tag key. All tag keys can be found in the [`dge.tag` table](#dgetag). DGE will post a `dge.msg.collide_passable` or `dge.msg.collide_impassable` message to your character's `on_message()` function when your character collides with any grid box. Custom tags may be inserted into the `dge.tag` table if you wish to detect additional collision cases. See all [tag-related functions](#dgegettagname) for details.

You may now register your characters:

```
local character_config = {
    size = vmath.vector3(16, 32, 0),
    direction = dge.direction.down,
    speed = 3
}

function init(self)
    self.dge = dge.register(character_config)
end
```

1. `size`: Size of your character in pixels.
2. `direction`: Initial direction in which your character is looking.
3. `speed`: Movement speed in grid boxes per second.

DGE snaps your character into a grid box on registration. To do this, the bottom-center `stride x stride` square region of your character is used to properly position it onto the grid. This snapped position is important because it affects the return value of the `self.dge.reach()` function as well as other movement mechanics. In the future, this region will be modifiable and will be relevant in collision response, utility functions, and more.

You may now utilize all of DGE's features by referencing `self.dge.FUNCTION_NAME()`.

In addition to initialization and registration, you must also include updating and unregistration in your character's script:

```
function update(self, dt)
    self.dge.update(dt)
end

function final(self)
    self.dge.unregister()
end
```

## API: Properties

### dge.direction

Table for referencing character orientation.

```
dge.direction = {
    up = { value = 1, string = "up" },
    left = { value = 2, string = "left" },
    down = { value = 4, string = "down" },
    right = { value = 8, string = "right" }
}
```

1. `value`: Identification value of this direction.  
2. `string`: String representation of this direction.

### dge.msg

Table for referencing messages posted to your character's `on_message()` function:

```
dge.msg = {
    move_start = hash("move_start"),
    move_end = hash("move_end"),
    move_repeat = hash("move_repeat")
}
```

1. `move_start`: Posted when the character starts moving from rest.
2. `move_end`: Posted when the character stops moving.
3. `move_repeat`: Posted when the character continues moving between grid boxes without stopping.

### dge.tag

Table for referencing collision tags. Each key (index of tag) corresponds to the integer used in your collision map, which was passed to `dge.set_collision()` when you initialized DGE. Custom tags may be inserted if you wish to detect additional collision cases. See all [tag-related functions](#dgegettagname) for details.

```
dge.tag = {
    { name = hash("passable"), passable = true },
    { name = hash("impassable"), passable = false }
}
```

1. `name`: Hash of a string representation of this tag.
2. `passable`: `bool` indicating whether characters may pass through grid boxes assigned to this tag.
